## Overview

onezero provides a simple to use interface for common calculations carried out
when analyzing binary data. The package assumes that a value of `1` corresponds to
the presence of an event, and a `0` corresponds to the absence of an event. 
There are three main types of functions included:

### Helper functions

In order for the functions (which actually calculate things) to do their jobs, 
data must be coded into ones, zeros, or missing. Two helper functions aide in 
this:

* `onezero` recodes a vector into ones and zeros, anything not specified
by `one` and `zero` are considered missing.
* `is_onezero` checks to see if the vector contains `1`/`0`/`NA`. It's used 
internally in all of the functions, but can also be handy when paired with `dplyr::select`/`mutate_if`.

### Analysis functions (for data frames)

These functions take a data frame as their main argument and the function is
carried out across all pairwise columns in the set. These include:

* `p`/`n_marginal` marginal probabilities (or counts).
* `p`/`n_union` probability (or counts) of union.
* `p`/`n_intersect` probability (or counts) of intersection.
* `p`/`n_conditional` conditional probabilities (or counts).
* `jaccard` [Jaccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) index or distance.

These all (except `*_marginal`) return either an `m x m` matrix of probabilities or
a 3 column data frame in "long" form (see `tidyr::pivot_longer`), whereas `*_marginal`
returns a vector or a 2 column data frame.

### Analysis functions (for vectors)

Where the above functions are useful when calculating probabilities/counts across
pairwise combinations, sometimes it's only necessary to look at one or two variables
at a time. These are especially useful when working inside a `dplyr` style workflow.
For such occasions, the following functions are available:

* `p_of` calculates the probability of one variable and/or/given/not some other variable.
* `n_of` performs the same operation but instead returns counts.


## Installation

Proceed with caution: package is in early stage of development and things **will** change.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ttrodrigz/onezero")
```

## Usage

This ain't ready to be used yet :)
